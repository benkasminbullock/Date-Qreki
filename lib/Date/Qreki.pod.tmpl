=head1 NAME

Date::Qreki - convert Gregorian to Japanese "kyureki" dates.

=head1 VERSION

This documents [% info.colon %] version [% info.version %]
corresponding to git commit L<[% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo
%]/commit/[% commit.commit %]> released on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains functions related to the old Japanese lunar
calendar.  Convert Western dates to old Japanese lunar calendar dates
with L</calc_kyureki>. Get the fortune-telling day with
L</get_rokuyou> or L</rokuyou_unicode>. Check if a date is a solar
term with L</check_24sekki>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 calc_kyureki

	@kyureki = calc_kyureki ($year, $mon, $day);

Given a western date, return the corresponding old Japanese calendar
date. The return value is an array containing the following fields.

=over

=item kyureki[0] - the corresponding year

=item kyureki[1] - if the month is a leap month (intercalary month)

See L<the Wikipedia article on
Intercalation|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping)>
for an explanation.

=item kyureki[2] - the corresponding lunar month

=item kyureki[3] - the corresponding day of the lunar month

=back

=head2 get_rokuyou

	$rokuyou = get_rokuyou ($year,$mon,$day);

Get Japanese fortune telling day. Response is from 0 to 5
corresponding to kanji names 0:大安 1:赤口 2:先勝 3:友引 4:先負 5:仏滅.
See also L</rokuyou_unicode> for a version which returns the kanji
names of the days.

=head2 rokuyou_unicode

    my $rokuyou = rokuyou_unicode (2017, 1, 30);

This returns the kanji form of the rokuyou, which are six Japanese
fortune telling days. The three arguments are year, month, and day in
the modern calendar. This just calls L</get_rokuyou> with the dates
then returns a Unicode version of the date. See, for example,
L<WWWJDIC|http://www.edrdg.org/cgi-bin/wwwjdic/wwwjdic?1C> for the
meanings of each of these day names.

[% since('0.07') %]

=head2 check_24sekki

    my $sekki = check_24sekki ($year, $month, $day);

Is today a L<Solar term|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_term>?  If
today is a solar term, it returns the Japanese name of the solar term
corresponding to the date given. The response is in character (utf8)
format.

original scripts, and do not modify the original script and its
documentation. This also applies if the archive format (.arc, .zip,
.zoo, etc.) is changed.

ii. I forbid any resale of this program beyond the cost of
distribution media. (This also applies if the program is translated to
a different programming language).

iii. If this is translated to a different programming language, or if
part or all of this script is used as part of another program, please
be sure to include the original script and this explanation with
it. If part of this program is used, I retain the copyright of the

[% MACRO original(file) BLOCK -%]

[%- END %]

As required by the above licence, the original Awk script [%
original("qreki.awk") %] and its documentation [%
original("qreki.doc") %] are in the subdirectory F<originals> in the
distribution. These are text files in
L<Shift-JIS|http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/encodings.html#encodings-Shift-JIS>
format. To read them on a modern terminal, use something like

    iconv -f CP932 -t UTF-8  originals/qreki.doc

or

    perl -MEncode -n -e "print encode_utf8 (decode ('CP932', \$_));" < originals/qreki.doc

Web browsers also may or may not be able to render these
files. Currently Google Chrome seems to be the only browser with
Shift-JIS capabilities.
